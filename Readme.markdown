GNToggleBar
===========

GNToggleBar is a custom control for the iPhone developed as part of [Gnarus][gnarus].

It looks much like a UITabBar but instead of switching views it handles multiple items to be toggled. For additional items it can be pulled up from the bottom to reveal a table of items. 

At this point it lacks some functionality and customizability, but provides a base level.
